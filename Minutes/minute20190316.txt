What time series?
* Commodity prices, energy, agriculture, metals

What do we investigate?
* appropriate models fitted for commodity price time series
* relationships among different time series, say crude oil vs natural gas (intra bucket), gold vs grains (inter bucket)
* forecast future commodity prices to price corresponding futures and derivatives

What model?
* GARCH

Why GARCH?
* if AR —> ARCH: autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity
* if ARMA —> GARCH: generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity
* closely related to our course

What application?
* option/future pricing
* Asian Option: average option, path dependent, geometric/arithmetic average at discrete intervals, usually for commodities.
* eg, call payoff = max(avg(S1, S2, S3, …) - K, 0)
